# 🛍️ RetailFusion ETL Platform

A cloud-native, production-grade ETL pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads retail data from multiple sources (CSV, API, SQL) into **Google BigQuery** for centralized analytics. Built using modular Python scripts and orchestrated with **Apache Airflow**, this pipeline simulates a real-world data engineering workflow deployed in GCP.

## 🚀 Features

- Extract data from:
  - 📄 CSV Files (Product Catalogs)
  - 🌐 REST API (Exchange Rates)
  - 🛢️ MySQL Database (Transactional Sales Data)
- Transformations using Pandas:
  - Null handling, timestamp standardization
  - Currency normalization (USD → INR)
  - Daily aggregated metrics (sales per product/category)
- Load data to:
  - 🪣 Google Cloud Storage (as Parquet)
  - 🧠 Google BigQuery (partitioned and clustered tables)
- ⏱️ DAG orchestration with Airflow
- 🔐 Secure secrets with GCP Secret Manager
- 📋 YAML-based config management
- 🐞 Robust logging & error handling
